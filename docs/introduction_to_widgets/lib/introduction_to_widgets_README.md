- MaterialApp widget, which builds a number of useful widgets at the root of your app, including a Navigator, which manages a stack of widgets identified by strings, also known as “routes”. The Navigator lets you transition smoothly between screens of your application. Using the MaterialApp widget is entirely optional but a good practice.

# Note: Material is one of the 2 bundled designs included with Flutter. To create an iOS-centric design, see the Cupertino components package, which has its own versions of CupertinoApp, and CupertinoNavigationBar.
